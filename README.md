## Mobile App

The mobile app for our restaurant management and social media project includes the manager and customer interfaces in this repository. Customers may use the app to scan QR codes on restaurant tables, order food, follow their favorite restaurants, and search for nearby eateries.

The manager interface for our restaurant management and social media project is accessible through this repository. Restaurant managers may add locations, create menus, view statistics, and share updates using the app.

## Project Overview

This project consists of multiple components, including:

- [Mobile App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_mobile): The customer interface of the mobile app, allowing customers to follow restaurants, search for restaurants, and scan QR codes on restaurant tables. The manager interface of the mobile app, allowing restaurant managers to add restaurants, design menus, and share posts.
- [Desktop App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_desktop): The desktop application for waiters to view and manage orders in the restaurant.
- [Web App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_web): A web application that displays the restaurant menu without requiring users to download the mobile app.
